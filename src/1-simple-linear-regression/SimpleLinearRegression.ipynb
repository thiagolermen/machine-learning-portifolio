Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities. You'd like to figure out what the expected profit of a new food truck might be given only the population of the city that it would be placed in."
