# Machine Learning Portifolio

## About

This portfolio aims to present small projects aimed at learning the main topics of machine learning.

In addition, a course has written on the themes studied in order to facilitate theoretical learning in the area of AI.

This course has been written to assist students with an interest in ML and AI. It consists of practical tasks based on the Machine Learning (Coursera) course taught by Andrew Ng and theoretical readings available in the PDF, the link of which is below. The course has been produced by the group PET Computação UFRGS, in May 2021.

The knowledge acquired for the development of this portofilio was acquired through the following courses and classes:

  1. Machine Learning (Coursera) | Stanford University
  2. Deep Learning Lecture Series 2020 | DeepMind & University College London
  3. Reinforcement Learning Course | DeepMind & University College London
  4. CS229: Machine Learning | Stanford University
  5. CS230: Deep Learning | Stanford University
  6. CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition | Stanford University
  7. CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning | Stanford University
  8. CS234: Reinforcement Learning | Stanford University

You can find the PDF of the course [here](https://github.com/thiagolermen/ml-course/blob/main/assets/Machine_Learning.pdf).

The projects were developed using Python. The projects were developed from scratch or using frameworks as PyTorch and Tensorflow 2.0.

## Projects and assignments
The course provides some didactic resources to put into practice the knowledge obtained from reading the PDF. The portfolio covers the following ML topics:
  1. Simple linear regression
  2. Multivariate linear regression
  3. Logistic regression
  4. Multivariate logistic regression
  5. Neural networks
  6. Convolutional neural networks
  7. Support vector machines
  8. Recurrent neural networks
  9. Generative adversarial networks

The datasets were taken from the machine learning course by professor Andrew Ng (Coursera) and they are available at ```data``` folder. Others were imported directly from the libraries of the frameworks used.
