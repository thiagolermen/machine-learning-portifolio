# Machine Learning Portifolio

## About

This portfolio aims to present small projects developed during my ML studies.

The projects cover the most diverse areas of ML that will be described below.

Along the way I wrote a course covering these areas and this course can be found at ```materials/Machine_Learning.pdf```. This course has been written to assist students with an interest in ML and AI. This consists of a summary of the subjects studied, which serves as an incentive to research a topic that may be of interest to the student. In addition, each of the projects developed aims to put this knowledge into practice. Some of the projects were based on the Machine Learning (Coursera) course materials taught by Professor Andrew Ng, such as datasets and activity descriptions. The course has been produced by the group PET Computação UFRGS, in May 2021.

## Course
I've writen this course as a fellow in PET Computação UFRGS, in May 2021. 

The knowledge for the development of this course was acquired through the following courses and classes:

  1. Machine Learning (Coursera) | Stanford University - Professor Andrew Ng
  2. Deep Learning Lecture Series 2020 | DeepMind & University College London
  3. Reinforcement Learning Course | DeepMind & University College London
  4. CS229: Machine Learning | Stanford University
  5. CS230: Deep Learning | Stanford University
  6. CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition | Stanford University
  7. CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning | Stanford University
  8. CS234: Reinforcement Learning | Stanford University

You can find the PDF of the course [here](https://github.com/thiagolermen/machine-learning-portifolio/blob/main/materials/Machine_Learning.pdf).

With the course you will learn the basics of
  1. Supervised learning
  2. Linear regression
  3. Logistic regression
  4. Support vector machines
  5. K-Neares Neighbors
  6. K-Means Clustering
  7. Neural Networks
  8. Unupervised learning
  9. K-Means clustering
  10. Reinforcement learning
  11. ML Optimizations
  12. Convolutional neural networks
  13. Object detection
  14. Recurrent neural networks
  15. Attention
  16. Transformers
  17. Generative models
  18. Monte Carlo search
  19. Deep Q-learning

## Projects
The projects were developed in the Python programming language using frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow. Some of the projects were implemented from scratch.

The projects are divided in three sections:
  1. ML Algorithms
  2. Architectures
  3. Projects

In ML Algorithms, several algorithms used in ML were implemented, such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, SVM, KNN, KMeans, Naive Bayes, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers and Object Detection.

In Architectures, the most famous neural network architectures were implemented, such as LeNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet and EfficientNet.

In Projects were developed several simple projects involving machine learning which serve as a basis for the development of more complex ones.


## Table Of Contents
The course provides some didactic resources to put into practice the knowledge obtained from reading the PDF. The portfolio covers the following ML topics:
  1. Simple linear regression
  2. Multivariate linear regression
  3. Logistic regression
  4. Multivariate logistic regression
  5. Neural networks
  6. Convolutional neural networks
  7. Support vector machines
  8. Recurrent neural networks
  9. Generative adversarial networks

The datasets were taken from the machine learning course by professor Andrew Ng (Coursera) and they are available at ```data``` folder. Others were imported directly from the libraries of the frameworks used.
